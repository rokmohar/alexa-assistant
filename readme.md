# alexa-assistant

Implementation of the Google Assistant API for Alexa

# Build and Deploy

Run the following commands:

- `docker build -t mylambda .`

- `docker run --rm -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="" -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="" mylambda`

You must set values of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variables in the command.
You can get the access key ID and secret access key in IAM section of the AWS console.

You can override the AWS Lambda function name by adding `-e AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=""` to the docker run command.

Complete documentation for AWS Lambda Docker images can be found here:

# Release 2.1

### THIS SKILL IS FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY AND IS NOT ENDORSED BY GOOGLE OR AMAZON. WHILST THIS SKILL USES AN OFFICIAL GOOGLE API, IT WILL NEVER PASS AMAZON CERTIFICATION DUE TO THE WAY THE RESPONSES ARE HOSTED.


# What's New in this release

1. Supports latest Google Assistant API
2. No longer uses Amazon Polly so should be completely free to use within the Free AWS Tier
3. Supports languages other than US English via configuration in Google Assistant mobile app
4. Supports localisation, again via Google Assistant mobile app
5. Added support for devices with screen like the Show and Spot - this will display text responses when available
6. Lambda function is now deployed via a hosted cloudformation config. This means you don't need to download the skill code from github and most of the settings are automatically configured. It should make upgrading the skill easier in the future

# Why do I need a credit card?

The skill is hosted on AWS which is an Amazon service. The usage of this skill is free for many thousands of requests however Amazon still require a credit card incase you start using their services beyond the free limits. Your credit card details stay with Amazon - neither I nor any other developers can access them.

There is no way around this. If you don't want to give your credit card details to Amazon then you cannot install and run this skill - sorry

# Sites reproducing installation instructions

The skill software in this GitHub project is provided as open source so you are welcome to distribute and modify as per the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE)

I do however have to pay the costs of hosting the cloudformation templates and zip files on AWS S3. As such the instructions for deploying this skill and the CloudFormation template linked within are now held in a seperate [GitHub project](https://github.com/tartanguru/alexa-assistant-instructions) which is licenced under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)

If you wish to reproduce the installation instructions hosted on your own website (**I really wish you wouldn't as it makes my life very difficult to support and update the skill**) then you may do so and link to my Cloudformation template (and consequently the zips on my S3 buckets)  provided that there is no monetisation on the page e.g. adverts. If you do wish to have monetisation then you will need to create your own instructions and host your own Cloudformation template and associated zip files. 

I AM VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS POINT - I WILL BE CHECKING FREQUENTLY AND WILL CHANGE OR REMOVE THE CLOUDFORMATION TEMPLATE URL IF PEOPLE ARE ABUSING IT

NOTE: I have granted Paul Hibbert the rights to link to the Cloudformation for the purposes of his installation videos

# Upgrading from version 1 of the skill

If you already have the original version of the skill which was installed manuallly WITHOUT using Cloudformation then please read the upgrade instructions here:-

[Upgrade Instructions](https://github.com/tartanguru/alexa-assistant-instructions/blob/master/upgrade.md)

# New Installation via CloudFormation 

This is the easiest method as it creates the lambda function automatically for you.

NOTE - PLEASE ONLY USE THE CLOUDFORMATION TEMPLATE URL PROVIDED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS GITHUB SITE OR PAUL HIBBERTS VIDEO. 
I CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF URLS GIVEN ON OTHER SITES

If you have not installed the skill before then follow the instructions here:-

[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/tartanguru/alexa-assistant-instructions/blob/master/fresh_install.md)

Otherwise watch Paul Hibberts excellent installation video here:-

# IT DOESN'T WORK / PROBLEM SOLVING

**BEFORE RAISING A QUESTION PLEASE CHECK THE PROBLEM SOLVING PAGE [HERE](https://github.com/tartanguru/alexa-assistant-instructions/blob/master/common_problems.md)**

I get asked the same questions many times a day and most of them due are missing steps in the instructions
