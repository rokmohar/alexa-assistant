# When I run the skill I get the error "I could not load the client secret file from S3. Please make sure that you have uploaded it into the correct place on the S3 bucket"

There are 3 likely causes:-

1. You have not uploaded your client_secret.json to the S3 bucket. Doing so will fix this issue
2. You have incorrectly renamed the file. Rename it correctly and re-upload to the S3 bucket. This will fix the issue
3. You have renamed the file client_secret.json.json as file extensions are hidden on your system. Remove the extra .json and re-upload to the S3 bucket. This will fix the issue
