Implementation of the Google Assistant API for Alexa

# Download Release

You can download the ZIP file from the [Releases](https://github.com/rokmohar/alexa-assistant/releases)
page and upload them to the AWS Lambda function from the AWS console.

# Build and Deploy

Run the following commands:

- `docker build -t mylambda .`

- `docker run --rm -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="" -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="" mylambda`

You must set values of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variables in the command.
You can get the access key ID and secret access key in IAM section of the AWS console.
Make sure that your IAM user has role AWSLambdaFullAccess.

You can override the AWS Lambda function name by adding `-e AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=""` to the docker run command.

You can copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` there.
Then you can run the command following command instead:

- `docker run --rm --env-file .env mylambda`

You can copy ZIP archive file from the Docker image to your host machine with the command:

`docker run --rm --entrypoint cat mylambda ./lambda.zip > ./lambda.zip`

# New Installation via CloudFormation
